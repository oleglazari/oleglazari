### Featured Research & Projects

 [**security-research**](https://github.com/ol2764RIT/security-research)  
> **Primary Disclosure Archive.** Includes Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and PoCs for discovered vulnerabilities.
> * **Notable Find:** Integer underflow in `CRoaring` (v4.5.1) leading to OOB reads. Regression test `safe_test_lazari` integrated into upstream.

 [**VRIG-RITSEC/fuzzillai**](https://github.com/VRIG-RITSEC/fuzzillai)  
> Researching agentic fuzzing pipelines using JIT-engine fuzzer **Fuzzilli**. Exploring LLM-augmented mutation for high-complexity targets.

 [**fuzzing-stuff**](https://github.com/ol2764RIT/fuzzing-stuff)  
> 10-day campaign on `libucl` using libFuzzer and sanitizers. Includes triage automation and seed corpus generation.

 [**RIT-EVT/HIB**](https://github.com/RIT-EVT/HIB)  
> Rider Control Interface firmware—high-integrity translation of analog throttle inputs to real-time digital motor control.
